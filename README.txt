Hi.

In case you are streaming this as part of a Secret Santa stream, I request that
you play this one last. This one is going to take a while.

If you are experiencing graphical bugs, please be sure to check that your
graphics card supports DirectX 9.

If you are viewing this from outside of the Shrines and Youkai circle, this project
was made for the 2024 Shrines and Youkai Secret Santa event. This project was made over
2 months, complete with 6 stages, 3 playable teams, dialogue and endings for each route
and much more. 

This project is still a W.I.P., as I plan to make enemy stage portions for each stage.

Please report any and all bugs to @joonkeh on Discord or at my Twitter @Joonkeh.

Enjoy~
